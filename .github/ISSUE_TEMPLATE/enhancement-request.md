**Is your enhancement request related to a specific problem or limitation? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of the problem you're trying to solve or the improvement you'd like to see.  
Example: "There's no way to automatically detect when a Flow uses 'Get Records' with 'Automatically store all fields' enabled, which can cause performance issues in large orgs."

**Describe the enhancement you'd like**
Clearly explain what should be added or changed.

- What new functionality do you want?
- What should the tool do differently?
- If it's a new static-analysis rule, describe exactly what it should detect and why.

**Proposed solution (optional)**
If you have an idea of how this could be implemented, share it here (e.g., new rule ID, AST pattern, error message, severity level).

**Example scenario**
Provide a concrete example:

- A Flow metadata snippet
- A screenshot
- Before/after behavior
- A real-world use case where this enhancement would help

**Additional context**
Add any other useful information:

- Links to Salesforce docs
- Related GitHub issues or PRs
- Error messages you’re seeing
- Performance impact
- Community discussions (e.g., Trailblazer answers, Slack threads)
