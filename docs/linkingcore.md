## Instructions for Using NPM Link and Testing the Core Module

### Using NPM Link
By using `npm link`, you can make use of your locally compiled Node Modules. This is especially useful for testing changes in the Lightning Flow Scanner core module without needing to publish a new version. Here are the steps to do this:

#### Linking Core Module
1. **Clone the Core Module**: Ensure you have cloned the `lightning-flow-scanner-core` repository locally.
2. **Link the Core Module**: Navigate to the core module's directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```
3. **Link to Project**: Navigate to the VS Code extension or SFDX plugin directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm link lightning-flow-scanner-core
    ```
    Once linked, your local version will be updated in the VS Code extension or SFDX plugin every time you run a new build.



### Testing VS Code Plugin
1. **Compile the Project**: Run the following command to verify compilation:
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use:
    ```bash
    npm run prepack
    ```
2. **Launch Application**: After compiling, launch the application to test your changes.

### Testing SFDX Plugin
1. **Compile the Project**: Run the following command to verify compilation:
    ```bash
    npm run prepack
    ```

1. **Open Example Project**: Open the terminal and run the following command in the directory of an example flow project (or any other project that is supposed to be scanned):
    ```bash
    NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect-brk /Users/rubenhalman/Projects/lightning-flow-scanner-sfdx/bin/run flow:scan
    ```
2. **Attach Debugger**: Go back to your local SFDX project in VS Code, set your desired breakpoints, and attach the debugger to the remote process.

### Publishing
Once you have tested your changes, you can publish the new package version by running:
```bash
npm publish
